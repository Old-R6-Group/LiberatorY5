Making the liberator for Year 5 and Newer versions.

Old UI will be available!\
New UI is need to be default!

Currently you can start the NewUI with `LiberatorY5.exe -newui`\
And to use Old UI just start the exe without any arguments.

`-debug` => Enable Debug, writing debug things to **debug-logs.txt**
